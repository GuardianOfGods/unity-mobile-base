👋 **Hi there, I'm HoangVanThu**. This repository help you to build games on mobile devices.
- Project is a sample gamebase for mobile game using **singleton design pattern**, you can get used to it very easily and build a complete game quickly. Besides, the utilities of the **custom packages** will help you a lot in searching, displaying and programming.
- However, I do not recommend using it for large game projects. Anyway it is a bad pattern, you can see or read about it everywhere on the internet.

## Installation
- Version: **Unity  2022.3.33f1 LTS**
- Type select: **Android**, **IOS**
