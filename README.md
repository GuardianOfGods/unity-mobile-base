# Mobile Game Base - Core Singleton architecture (Android & Ios)

- Project is a sample gamebase for mobile game using **singleton design pattern**.
- Because the project is designed using the singleton pattern, you can get used to it very easily and build a complete game quickly. However, I do not recommend using it for large game projects. Anyway it is a bad pattern, you can see or read about it everywhere on the internet.
